# SabatageSwap  
DeathSwap from Dream's videos, except it's free, and **works with more than 2 players**.  
Fully functional and simple lobby system.

# Concept
Every 3 to 5.5 minutes, every player on the sever gets their location swapped with another player at random. PvP is permanently disabled, so the only way to kill other players is to build traps.

# Lobby System
During the lobby period, all damage for all entities are disabled, no hunger or saturation will be lost, players can not break or place blocks, and players can not pick up or drop items.

When a player joins the server, they'll be given a red wool, which they can right click to indicate that they're ready. Once every player on the server is ready, if there is at least 2 players, the game will start. There will be a 10 minute grace period before the first swap. Every swap afterwards is randomly set between 3 to 5.5 minutes.
